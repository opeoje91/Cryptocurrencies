# Cryptocurrencies

Created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.
I processed the data to fit the machine learning models and used unsupervised machine learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I used clustering algorithm and data visualizations to share my findings with the board.
